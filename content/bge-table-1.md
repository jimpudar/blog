Summary: Initial thoughts on the design of a wooden table for a Big Green Egg
Status: published

After our Good Friday Fish Fry / Bridal Shower was canceled due to the
COVID-19 shelter-in-place guidelines, Melissa and I were recently gifted an
[XL Big Green Egg](https://biggreenegg.com/xlarge-big-green-egg/) by my
parents and all my aunts and uncles on my mom's side. A couple of guys from
[Big George's](https://www.big-georges.com/) delivered the Egg and set it up
without coming into contact with us. It's a very beautiful cooker that weighs
just over 200 lbs. To bring it up to comfortable cooking height, it arrived
with an [EGG Nest](https://biggreenegg.com/product/egg-nest/), a fabricated
metal pedestal on casters.

I have a few problems with the Nest:

- The fragile Egg can easily be tipped over
- The wooden deck below the Egg has no protection from heat
- There are no work surfaces next to the grill and no storage for accessories
- The casters are not great
